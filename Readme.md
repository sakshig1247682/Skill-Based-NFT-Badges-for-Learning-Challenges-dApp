## Project Description
The **Skill-Based NFT Badges for Learning Challenges** platform is a blockchain-powered system that rewards learners with unique NFT badges upon completing educational challenges. Each badge represents a specific skill or achievement, stored as an immutable, verifiable asset on the blockchain. This gamified approach to learning fosters engagement, provides proof of accomplishments, and encourages skill development in a decentralized manner.
